Conclusion\n","Upon conducte a thorough analysis of London housing prices between 1995 and 2018 I discovered that while boroughs experienced price growth, the scale of that growth varied significantly.By grouping the data by borough and year and calculating the mean house prices, I wAS able to smooth out short-term fluctuations and focus on long-term trends. Using a ratio of prices from the first to the last year allowed me to clearly compare relative growth across different boroughs. According to the results some outer London boroughs, such as Hackney, Waltham Forest, and Lewisham, experienced the most dramatic proportional increases in average house prices. This pattern of sharp increase in house prices could be linked to regentrification. In contrast other Boroughs, while already considered on the higher end of the price scale, showed slower proportional growth over the same period.\n","\n","Overall, the project highlights how systematic data cleaning, transformation, and visualization can uncover meaningful socio-economic patterns. The findings suggest that housing affordability and demand in London shifted considerably during this period, with outer boroughs catching up in price growth relative to central areas. This not only illustrates changing dynamics in the housing market but also demonstrates the value of data analysis for identifying long-term trends in urban development."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":[],"name":"Springboard Data Science Career Track Unit 4 Challenge - Tier 3 Complete .ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
